        <img src="frenchtoast.png">
        <p>This has to be one of my favorite breakfasts of all time. It is crutial for the yummy factor to use thick bread of pretty much any kind: white, whole wheat, brioche, cinnamon-raisin, Italian or French. Be sure not to put the bread on the pan until it is completely hot.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2/3 cup milk (dairy or nut/oat)</li>

            <li>6 thick slices of bread</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, or more as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Directions</h4>

        <ol>
